1. What accessibility challenges did you face, and how did you address them?
* One of the challenges I found in accessibility was figuring out what were the right types of semantic element was right for the job as well as using aria labeling properties correctly. I addressed them by carefully looking up the MDN on a few semantic tags as well as studying the aria properties. Another small challenge was figuring the correct color palette to ensure colors between background and text were readable.

2. How did you ensure that your design was responsive and accessible to all users?
* My web pages are full of flexboxes so they shrink and grow as needed. The navbar collapses when the screen size detects that a mobile phone user is browsing, making the navbar a little more accessible for mobile phones. Using tab on the keyboard highlights links, buttons, and interactable elements such as textboxes.

3. What tools or resources did you find most helpful during this project?
* Definitely the MDN along with css-tricks for visualizing flexboxes and grids, though MDN came in handy for those flexboxes too.
